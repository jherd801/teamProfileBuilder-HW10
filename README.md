# Description:
This application allows users to build a team profile comprised of manager, engineer, and intern information for each team member. Information is prompted through the command line and asks what type of employee you are looking to add, then based on that selection asks specific questions related to each employee type. When no more employees are being added and the correct selection is made, the application closes and renders an output directory with a compiled and renderable HTML page to be viewed in the browser.
